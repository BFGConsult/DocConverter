# DocConverter
DocConverter is as the name suggests a document converter. It has a modularized design which in principle allows any 
documentformat to be converted to any other documentformat, as long as there is a reasonable transition path between them.

The DocConverter was conceived because I often needed to convert between documentformats, but got fed up with having to pull large dependencies, just for a simple task.
